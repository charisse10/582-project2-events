## Introduction
This is a basic web application created as a partial requirement to complete two courses namely: Advanced Web Programming Technique and Web Framework as a fulfilment to the Web Design Specialist Program of Vanier College.

I was inspired to create an events app because my local community publishes summer events in a poster with different categories and placed on different sections and the layout makes it really hard to read. I want to create a web app to get it more organized and more flexible.


## Features
It will have 3 main views: Default, User, and Admin Page. I am simulating an authentication to the Admin and User Page.
1. The Default View displays all the events and filtering for easier viewing.
2. The User View displays all the events and filtering plus the ability to click on a button to like the event.
3. The Admin View displays all the events with a delete button to delete the event and a form to add new event to the database.
